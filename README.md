# Hello-World
This is the first time I come to say hello to the programming world
My name is Caihong R. Li. Currently I am a doctoral candidate in Quantiative and Psychometric Methods program, University of Kentucky.
The reason why I came here is because I found R programming is fun and would like to know more about it.
